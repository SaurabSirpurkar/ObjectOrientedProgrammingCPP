The autocomplete dictionary application found on mobile phones takes the advantage of a retrieval data
structure called Trie, which can be used to perform typical operations of finding a word present in a given
dictionary and inserting a new word in the dictionary. These operations can be performed in time
complexity linear in length of a word, which is not possible in data structures like Binary Search Tree. The
purpose of this assignment is to make you familiar with this retrieval data structure. You are given a
dictionary of words which you are required to maintain as a Trie data structure, by representing each Trie
node as an object (make use of OOP!). You are given another set of strings (which may be a valid word
already present in the dictionary) or may be just a prefix of a valid word present in the dictionary.
