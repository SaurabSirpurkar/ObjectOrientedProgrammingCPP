Problem Statement:
Your task is to design a program interpreter / error checker, based on object-oriented constructs taught till now.<br>
A code segment will be given as input. The interpreter must be able to perform a step-wise execution of the program while checking for any possible errors and reporting the same along with the corresponding line numbers (basically syntax and logical error checking). <br>
Assume that the codes given will have only two types of statements (assignment and print) and two types of operations (+ and -).
